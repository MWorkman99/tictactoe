# TicTacToe Games

## Memory Based
This program uses a brain of only 'memory' to incrementally learn how to play TicTacToe. 
The program creates two virtual players which play against each other automatically. As they play they remember the outcome of each game.
At the end of each game their winning memories are shown on the screen. This is the 'brain' at that moment. 
Their memories are then used in future games to make decisions.

This is a console program which simply runs on its own.
